Disclaimer and disclosure for non-lawyer LeXpunk DAO members

I am currently active in the following communities and have the following economic interests therein:

WACEO
CRD Network
TacoSwap

I also hold non-immaterial amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

I disclaim any responsibility to keep these disclosures up to date, but currently anticipate updating them from time to time to reflect the changes I deem sufficiently material to warrant disclosure.
