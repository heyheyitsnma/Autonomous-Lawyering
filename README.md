# Autonomous-Lawyering

The idea of autonomous lawyering is a new domain of legal advocacy that visions a strong convergence in many of the working streams from technology development such as open source, iterative and collaborative work and bug bounties. The main tenant is ensuring that legal risks are proactively addressed in the consistently uncharted waters of law and decentralised autonomous organisations. 

I engage in Autonomous Lawyering to help create more clarity in the blockchain industry for current and new buidlers. It's an important task to ensure that the innovative benefits of blockchain technology... it's borderless, permissionless nature that increases global financial freedom... is secured.
